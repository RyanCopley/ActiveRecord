ActiveRecord
============

Objective-C Model Subclass. Abuses Objective-C's dynamic nature to allow quickly storing "simple" classes to disk.

Depends on FMDB, available at https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb.

Syntax is fairly similar to the Yii::CActiveRecord. Mainly because that is what I based it off of. Some functions might be slightly differently named.
